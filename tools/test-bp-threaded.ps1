# Regression rig for 465a3873 -- a TRACEPOINT over a THREADed (.cwtls) name, hit REPEATEDLY WITHOUT
# PAUSING, then resumed and hit again.
#
# Why a tracepoint and not a conditional breakpoint: a tracepoint NEVER pauses (DebugEngine.BpAdvanced.cs
# logs and returns false), so every hit takes the DBG_CONTINUE path out of OnUserBp that never reaches
# PausedWait. That is the exact path the old code could not read .cwtls data on, and the exact path a
# cached instance base would go stale across. It also LOGS the value it read on each hit, so the test can
# see what the engine actually resolved instead of inferring it from whether a stop happened.
#
# A single-hit test passes while the stale-cache defect is fully present, so the run is deliberately
# structured as: many hits -> explicit pause -> watch (cross-check) -> resume -> many more hits.
#
# The launch, the output pump and the cleanup come from engine-session.ps1, shared with
# test-interactive.ps1 and test-watch-threaded.ps1. This file used to carry its own copy, and the copy got
# the cleanup wrong in the way a copy does: it killed whatever `Get-Process -Id $targetPid` returned, with
# no check of the process NAME or of its start time. A pid is not an identity -- Windows recycles them --
# so if the debuggee exited before the finally block ran, that killed an unrelated developer process. The
# shared Get-EngineTargetProcess verifies pid AND name AND "started after this session did" in one place
# (337b3222 item 9).
#
# THE POKES ARE SIGNALS TOO. EnumWindows keyed on a bare pid posts WM_COMMAND / WM_NULL into whatever process
# owns that pid at that instant, so "Stop-EngineTarget is the only thing here that signals the debuggee" was
# never true of this file. Both poke sites below resolve through the shared Get-EngineTargetPid immediately
# before posting, and skip - out loud - when the target cannot be verified.
#
# SECOND PART, THE RE-ARM RACE (ca29e2da). The engine re-arms a breakpoint by putting the original byte back,
# single-stepping the thread that hit it and planting the INT3 again at that thread's trap; before the fix
# every OTHER thread ran during that step, and one that reached the address then went straight past the
# breakpoint. tools\fixtures\racebp has two threads call one procedure a fixed number of times each, so a
# tracepoint on its body has an exact expected hit count, and a short count is the race. Measured 2026-09-25
# with 2000 iterations (4000 hits expected): the engine at 0d9d44b reported 1827 and 1124 here (a tracepoint,
# the silent re-arm route) and 575, 2000, 369, 2001 and 2009 as a plain non-interactive breakpoint; the fixed
# engine 4000 every time. It needs Clarion 11 to build the fixture; -SkipRace leaves it out. A pass is
# evidence, not proof that no interleaving misses one: protocolcheck CheckRearmHold pins the bookkeeping.
