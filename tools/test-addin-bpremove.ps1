# Regression check: OnGutterBpRemoved trims the pad's staging list only when the engine took the removal.
#
# _pending (what StartSession resends wholesale) and _svc.Breakpoints (the engine's live list) are separate,
# and they can diverge in BOTH directions:
#   - trim too little, and a breakpoint removed mid-session is resurrected at the next start (fixed in 7ff1989);
#   - trim too eagerly, and a removal the engine REFUSED is forgotten by the pad while staying ARMED in the
#     live session. The user then gets a stop with nothing on screen to account for it, and nothing left to
#     retry the removal from.
#
# RemoveBreakpoint returns false for real reasons: IsValidModuleName rejects the module, or SendCommand fails
# because the engine pipe is gone. Neither is visible from the page.
#
# THE ONLY DISCRIMINATING CASE IS A FAILING REMOVAL. When the engine accepts the removal, trimming before the
# call and trimming after it are indistinguishable - a happy-path check passes identically against the old
# ordering and the new one, and so proves nothing. That is why the checks below lean on RemoveBreakpoint
# returning FALSE.
#
# This compiles the REAL OnGutterBpRemoved and SameBp straight out of ClarionDebuggerWebView.cs - extracted by
# brace matching, the same trick tools/test-addin-json.ps1 uses - against stub collaborators, so the ordering
# under test is the shipped ordering and not a paraphrase of it.
