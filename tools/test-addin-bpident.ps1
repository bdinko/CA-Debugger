# Regression check: which FILE a breakpoint row means, when two loaded DLLs each hold a .clw of that name.
#
# A breakpoint is named on the wire by a bare .clw BASENAME. In a multi-DLL app two images can each carry a
# clbrws011.clw, and if both are bookmarked at the same line the host has two files and one name. Two things
# then went wrong, both silently, and neither reachable from the engine-side suites:
#
#   - SendBps built its (module|line) -> path map with a plain assignment, so the SECOND gutter bookmark
#     overwrote the first. A pane row could carry the OTHER file's path, and clicking the filename opened
#     the wrong source. OpenBp's File.Exists cannot catch that: both files exist.
#   - RemoveByModuleLine removed the FIRST bookmark whose module/line matched, so the pane's "x" on one
#     breakpoint could clear the other file's red dot.
#
# Task e80072f1. This compiles the REAL ClaimGutterPath / GutterPathFor out of ClarionDebuggerWebView.cs and
# the REAL RemoveByModuleLine / TryMap out of EditorBreakpointService.cs - extracted by brace matching, the
# same trick tools/test-addin-json.ps1 and tools/test-addin-bpremove.ps1 use - against stub collaborators,
# so what is under test is the shipped code and not a paraphrase of it. The breakpoint record is the
# shipped one too, lifted out of ClarionDebuggerService.cs.
#
#   pwsh tools/test-addin-bpident.ps1
# Exit code 0 = all checks passed.
