# Regression check: which IMAGE a breakpoint is armed in, when two loaded DLLs each carry a same-named .clw.
#
# A .clw name on the wire is a bare BASENAME. The old `OwnerOfModule` (removed) answered "the first loaded image carrying it",
# so in a multi-DLL app the user's second gutter dot was folded into the first breakpoint and NEVER ARMED:
# a dot on screen asserting it will stop, and a debugger that silently does not. Task af81c054.
#
# WHAT THIS SUITE CAN AND CANNOT PROVE, stated up front because a green run must not imply more than it is:
#   CAN  - the spec grammar (including that an OLDER engine ignores the new segments), the image-matching
#          rule, and the two identity predicates that decide whether two breakpoints are one.
#   CANNOT - that a breakpoint is actually ARMED and FIRES in both images. That needs a real two-DLL
#          debuggee under the Windows debug API. Nothing here should be read as evidence of it.
#
# Everything below compiles the REAL bodies out of the engine source by brace matching - the same trick
# tools/test-addin-json.ps1 uses - so what is under test is the shipped code, not a paraphrase.
#
#   pwsh tools/test-engine-bpowner.ps1
# Exit code 0 = all checks passed, and exactly as many as it expects.
