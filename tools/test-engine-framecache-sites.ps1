#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (ticket bae5f46d). PausedWait calls ClearFrameCache(), which drops the per-stop
# stack-frame cache (_stopFrames) so that a resume never reuses the frames walked at the previous stop. Every
# watch, module-data and local read at a stop shares that one walk. Nothing else pinned the call site: deleting
# it compiled and passed every suite. Diana asked that the clear be UNCONDITIONAL and at the TOP LEVEL of
# PausedWait, so this check holds it there.
#
# ONE SITE ONLY (2026-09-24). Unlike HoverNewStop (test-engine-hover-sites.ps1), there is no second site in
# setip's re-announce: the cache is also keyed on EIP/ESP/EBP (FramesForStop in DebugEngine.StackWalker.cs), so
# a setip or a thread switch inside one stop re-walks on its own. The key does NOT cover a resume that lands on
# the same registers with a changed stack, which is why the top-level clear is required.
#
# POSITION, NOT TEXT. A check that the text `ClearFrameCache();` appears in PausedWait passes against
# `if (DateTime.Now.Year < 0) ClearFrameCache();`, a call that is still present and never runs (see the
# guard-deletion-vs-disabling note in this repo's history). So the check is structural. The call must be:
#   1. a statement at the TOP LEVEL of PausedWait's body (brace depth 1), so it is not inside any block;
#   2. the START of a statement (the code before it ends in ; { or }), so it is not the braceless body of
#      an if, else, while or for;
#   3. BEFORE the first TryDequeue, which is where the command loop starts;
#   4. preceded by no `return`, so no early exit can skip it.
# Comments are stripped first (Get-CSharpCodeOnly), so a comment that quotes the call cannot satisfy it.
#
# -SelfTest applies five mutations IN MEMORY and requires each to fail the check: the call deleted, the call
# wrapped in `if (DateTime.Now.Year < 0)`, the call moved after the loop, the call wrapped in a braced if, and
# an early return ahead of it.
#
# ASCII ONLY: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less .ps1 as CP1252.
