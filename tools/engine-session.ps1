# sink, and wait for a "paused" event. test-watch-threaded.ps1 used to carry its own compressed copy of
# all of that - Wait-Paused as a single ~600 character line, with Drain's body spelled out again inside
# it - which is how the two drifted apart (337b3222 item 10). One copy lives here now.
#
# The session also learns the DEBUGGEE's pid from the engine's own output, so a harness can poke and
# clean up the process THIS RUN started rather than every process that happens to share its name
# (337b3222 item 9).
