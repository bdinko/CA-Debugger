# LIVE: set next statement (task a77abd94) against clbrws.exe's SplashScreen.
#
# What only a live run can show, and protocolcheck cannot (ProtocolCheck.SetIp.cs covers the decision, the
# ACCEPT-region finder, the call proof, the observation store and the wire shapes over hand-built inputs):
#   - a successful setip really moves EIP, and re-announces the stop as `paused` reason "setip" at the new line;
#   - a Step after a setip starts from the NEW line (the pause loop's locals were recomputed, risk 6);
#   - THE OBSERVED PATH (a77abd94 item 3): SplashScreen calls runtime entries whose stack effect was never
#     measured (Cla$pmopen, Cla$BEEP, ...), so its moves cannot be PROVEN (census 2026-09-23: 683 of 2003
#     clbrws symbols provable). A move BACK to a line this frame already stopped on, at the same ESP, is allowed
#     "via observed"; a move FORWARD to a line not yet reached is refused as stack-unproven;
#   - THE RE-ARM HANDOVER (risk 5): from a stop on armed line 35, setip back onto armed line 33. The engine keeps
#     ONE re-arm per thread; without the handover the origin breakpoint at 35 is never re-planted and silently
#     stops firing, so the continue that follows runs on to the ACCEPT's breakpoint at 44 instead of stopping at
#     35. (Measured 2026-09-23 on the earlier 44->45 form of this case: disabling the handover turned the stop
#     into the wrong line.)
#   - NO OBSERVATION SURVIVES A FREE RUN (item 4, pipeline run 2): after a continue, a move back to a line seen
#     on the previous ACCEPT pass - same frame, same steady ESP - refuses; so does one after a step-out, which
#     ends as a "step" stop and so is caught only by the resume rule at ArmResume;
#   - THE ACCEPT RULES BIND BOTH PATHS (item 4): into or out of the loop refuses as accept-boundary even where
#     the target was observed. The sibling-loops case (equal ESP ACROSS a boundary) cannot happen in
#     SplashScreen's single ACCEPT, so only protocolcheck's fixture covers it;
#   - the refusals a real image produces: the entry record, a ROUTINE, a line with no code, another module,
#     bad arguments, and a Pause stop that is not on a statement.
#
# SplashScreen (clbrws026.clw, exe line numbering): 8 is the entry record, 32..42 run before the ACCEPT, 43 is
# the ACCEPT itself, 44..88 are its body, 89 follows the loop, 92 is in the PrepareProcedure ROUTINE.
