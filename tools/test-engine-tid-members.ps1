#
# WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (ticket 3b043dfc, hole 2).
#
# The absent-tid rule -- a thread id is a real Win32 tid or the member is ABSENT, never 0, never -1 -- has
# been broken four times now, and every single time on a path that BYPASSED the helper the rule lived in.
# Three of those were caught by a person looking, not by a test. a39d9477 gave the rule one holder, and
# 3b043dfc widened it past the name "tid" to every member that carries a thread id. Neither of those closes
# the actual hole, which is this: C# cannot stop the next person typing
#
#     sb.Append(",\"tid\":").Append(someTid);
#
# into a StringBuilder, and `ClarionDbg protocolcheck` will not grow to cover a new emitter by itself --
# it runs the builders it was told about, so an emitter nobody told it about is invisible to it. It also
# cannot do this job even in principle: protocolcheck has no source tree at runtime.
#
# So the enforcement has to read the source, and it does. The rule this asserts is an ABSOLUTE with one
# named exception class, which is the only shape of rule that survives someone adding a file:
#
#     A declared thread-id member name may appear as JSON text in src\ClarionDbg.Cli only as a per-row
#     BOOLEAN flag. There are exactly 3 of those and they are listed below. Every other occurrence is a
#     hand-written thread-id member, i.e. a bypass, and fails.
#
# The emitters pass a TidMember* CONSTANT to AppendTidValuedMember and WithTid builds its head from one
# too, so after 3b043dfc there is no legitimate reason for the text `\"tid\":` to exist in an engine
# source file at all. That is what makes the absolute honest rather than convenient.
#
# HOW IT READS THE SOURCE. Not with a regex over the whole file: a member name in a COMMENT (this repo's
# comments discuss `,"tid":` at length, including in the rule holder itself) is not an emit, and counting
# it would make the check cry wolf until someone deleted it. So the scan walks the file with
# Skip-CSharpLiteral from tools\lib-extract.ps1 -- the same routine test-addin-json.ps1 uses to lift real
# C# out of the shipped source -- which steps over comments, char literals and verbatim strings, and hands
# back each STRING LITERAL with its offset. Only literals are searched. Text that contains its own
# delimiters cannot be scanned by looking for the delimiters, which is the reason that routine exists.
#
# THE NAME SET IS NOT RETYPED HERE. It is extracted from DebugEngine.cs's own TidValuedMemberNames
# declaration and its TidMember* constants. A test holding its own copy of the set under test asserts only
# that two hand-written lists agree -- which is precisely the evidence that was missing every time this
# rule broke. Adding a fourth name to the engine puts it under this check automatically.
#
# ASCII ONLY, and deliberately: Windows PowerShell 5.1 reads a BOM-less UTF-8 .ps1 as CP1252, where the
# third byte of a UTF-8 em-dash is a smart quote it accepts as a string delimiter -- so an em-dash in a
# COMMENT can terminate a string lines away and fail the parse with a bogus "missing closing }".
