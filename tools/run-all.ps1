# There is no CI. Before this file the only full list of suites lived in the PM's spawn briefs, so a new
# suite was born unlisted and rotted unrun, and a green reported as "12 suites" was really 12 of 15 - the
# three missing were the three SLOWEST, which is what a list people have to remember always sheds.
#
# IT FAILS CLOSED, and each of these is a FAILURE, never a skip:
#   - a suite that exits non-zero;
#   - a suite that exits 0 WITHOUT printing its own success line. A top-level `break` in a harness gives
#     exit 0 and no summary at all (measured by ticket 60344b78: 69 of 222 checks, no summary, exit 0), so
#     an exit code alone would certify a suite that died politely;
#   - a tools\test-* file with no `suite:` header line, so a new suite cannot rot unlisted. The list is
#     DISCOVERED from those headers (w8-suite-header, tools\lib-suites.ps1), not hand-kept here: the old
#     $Suites array was hand-merged at every wave's integration. Discovery reads the files on disk, so the
#     old "listed but missing" failure can no longer arise;
#   - a malformed header line, a success regex not anchored with ^, and a .ps1 with a $SelfTest parameter
#     but no args=-SelfTest variant (lib-suites.ps1 lists the rest);
#   - fewer entries discovered than $MinEntries, so a suite deleted together with its header is noticed;
#   - a PowerShell suite that does not pin its own total with Assert-CheckTotal (tools\lib-check.ps1),
#     unless its header names why not (nototal=). The success line is only trustworthy if the suite counted
#     itself;
#   - a .ps1 anywhere in the repo that carries non-ASCII bytes without a UTF-8 BOM. Windows PowerShell 5.1
#     reads such a file as CP1252 and can fail to parse it far from the cause (ticket 718ea446);
#   - the engine build failing or warning, protocolcheck missing, or node missing.
# LIVE suites launch the Clarion example app under the engine and poke its windows. They are skipped by
# default with a visible "SKIPPED (live)" line - never silently - and run with -IncludeLive.
#
# Each PowerShell suite runs in a FRESH pwsh: most compile extracted C# with Add-Type, which cannot
# redefine a type already loaded in the process.
