    /// intended thread instead of the painted one; the painted flag outliving an erased listing). Here the
    /// only way to change a field is a transition, so a reader can see the whole machine in one file.

    /// WHAT IS NOT HERE, deliberately. The stopped and selected thread ids are caches of ENGINE state
    /// (ticket 1ab6be61 owns where that truth lives), so they are PARAMETERS to the transitions that need
    /// them, never fields. And the uint? -> uint conversion is DisassemblyView.TidOf's alone: every tid
