    /// ATTACH is DebugActiveProcess plus DebugSetProcessKillOnExit(FALSE). The debug loop is the launch loop:
    /// Windows replays the process as a synthetic CREATE_PROCESS, a CREATE_THREAD per thread and a LOAD_DLL per
    /// module, then an injected thread executes the attach breakpoint, which the loop already swallows as the
    /// initial break.
    ///
    /// DETACH runs in the debug loop, on whatever event it holds, because while ANY event is held the whole
    /// process is frozen. `detach` while paused returns from PausedWait and the loop detaches on the event that
    /// paused; `detach` while running injects a break and the loop detaches on the FIRST event to arrive, which
    /// may be that break or anything else. Order, all but the last three steps while frozen:
    ///   restore every planted byte (temp and user), drop the re-arms, clear TF on every thread, drop the setip
    ///   observations and the hover mode, CONTINUE the held event, DRAIN what is already queued, then stop.
    ///
    /// WHY THE DRAIN. Microsoft documents nothing about events still queued at DebugActiveProcessStop. The
    /// evidence (ReactOS DbgkClearProcessDebugObject; LLVM PR #115712, merged 2024-11-15) is that the kernel
    /// completes each of them as "the debugger did not handle it", so the exception goes to the app. A thread
    /// that hit one of our INT3s before the freeze would then take EXCEPTION_BREAKPOINT with EIP one byte into
    /// an instruction: crash, or resume mid-instruction. Draining answers those as a debugger would - rewind
    /// EIP, continue - before letting go. Once the bytes are back and TF is clear, nothing WE did can raise a
    /// new event, so anything arriving after the drain is an event the app would have had without a debugger.
