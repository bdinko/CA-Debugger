        // does this: while a thread steps off a restored byte, every other thread of the process is suspended.
        //
        // THE RULE IS RECONCILED AT EVERY CONTINUE, not set at each place that releases a thread with TF. Those
        // places are many (OnUserBpCore's silent and non-interactive routes, ArmResume after a breakpoint stop,
        // a stepi or a setip, OnTempBpCore's two re-arms, FinishSkipAt), and a hold set at each would need a
        // release at each of the ways out as well. At the continue there is one question: is a thread about to run that owes a
        // re-plant AND has TF set? If so it is the holder and everything else stays suspended; if not, nothing
        // is held. So the hold ends at the holder's first trap (OnSingleStep drops its re-plant), and equally
        // when its event is passed to the app (an exception: TF is not ours to count on across a handler),
        // when it exits (ForgetRearmThread drops the re-plant), at the process's exit, and at a detach.
        //
        // IT IS NEVER HELD ACROSS A STEP SESSION OR A CALL-SKIP: an ordinary step trap owes no re-plant, and a
        // call-skip runs with TF clear. Holding there would deadlock the first callee that waits on another
        // thread. It is one instruction, always.
        //
        // COUNTS ARE BALANCED PER TID: _held records exactly the threads whose SuspendThread WE made succeed, and
