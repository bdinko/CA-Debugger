        // ---------------------------------------------------------------- the absent-tid rule, in ONE place
        //
        // THE RULE: a thread id is either a real Win32 tid or the field is ABSENT. Never 0, never -1.
        //
        // The host treats an unstamped reply as UNSCOPED and accepts it, but reads a literal 0 (or -1) as a
        // real thread id: it then matches nothing, and the pad starts dropping replies it should have shown
        // — a silently blank panel rather than an error.
        //
        // The rule was broken THREE times in one day by two different agents (ticket a39d9477), every time on
        // a path that BYPASSED the helper the rule lived in. It lived in WithTid, which splices whole events;
        // the four hand-built emitters in DebugEngine.Threads.cs never went through it, so each either
        // re-implemented the rule or simply omitted it. So the rule now lives in ONE predicate below, and
        // BOTH writers derive from it — nothing else in the engine decides whether a tid is written.
        //
        // AND THE RULE IS NOT ABOUT THE NAME (ticket 3b043dfc). a39d9477 closed it for members literally
        // called "tid" and left three carrying a thread id under another name: the `threads` event's
        // top-level "stopped" and "selected", and `threadscan`'s top-level "stopped". Those were safe by
        // ORDERING — PausedWait sets _selectedTid before the pause loop can dispatch — while AcquireView in
        // this very file already treats _selectedTid == 0 as a state that happens. The engine did not agree
        // with itself, and that disagreement was the defect; no failure had been observed out of luck.
        // So the writer below takes the member NAME, and the names it will write are declared here, once.
        //
        // IF YOU ARE ADDING AN EMITTER: do not type the member. Call AppendTidValuedMember with one of the
        // TidMember* constants (or WithTid), and add your builder to ProtocolCheck.CheckHandBuiltTidEmitters,
        // which runs the REAL builders rather than copies of their shapes. A hand-typed `,"tid":` is the
        // exact defect this rule holder exists to stop, and no compiler can stop you typing it — but
        // tools/test-engine-tid-members.ps1 reads THIS SOURCE and fails when one is typed outside the
        // writer, which is the part protocolcheck cannot do (it has no source tree at runtime).
        //
        // WHY THIS IS NOT IN Json.cs with the other emitter helpers (f367a04f item 3, 2026-09-22): that suite and
