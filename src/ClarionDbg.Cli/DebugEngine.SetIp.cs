    // ------------------------------------------------------------------ set next statement (task a77abd94)
    //
    // `setip <module>:<line>` moves the STOPPED thread's EIP to that line's single code record, inside the
    // procedure it is already in, and re-announces the stop with reason "setip". It never runs target code.
    //
    // WHAT MAKES IT SAFE is one measured fact (a77abd94 item 0, clbrws, 2026-09-23, 363 stops): at every
    // statement boundary (a line record, gap 0) of one frame, ESP is the same, EXCEPT across an ACCEPT.
    // Clarion code is EBP-relative and balances its pushes within a statement, so moving EIP between two
    // boundaries of the same frame leaves nothing on the machine stack out of place.
    //
    // ACCEPT is the exception. It compiles to `call [IAT ClaRUN!Cla$StartEventLoop]` at the head and
    // `call [IAT Cla$EndEventLoop]; cmp al,0; je <return address of the Start call>` at the back-edge, and
    // ClaRUN keeps the loop's state ON THE PROCEDURE'S OWN STACK: the body ran 0xFC below the frame's base
    // in the steady state (both SplashScreen and BrowseAuthors), and deeper on the first one or two passes
    // (0x30 more, and once 0x1148 more). So:
    //   - inside one ACCEPT, staying inside it: safe. The current ESP IS the right ESP for every line of the
    //     region whatever the iteration, and EndEventLoop re-seats ESP on the back-edge;
    //   - across its boundary, either way: unsafe, and not fixable by adjusting ESP, because the first pass's
    //     depth is not the steady one. Refused as `accept-boundary`.
    // The rule compares the INNERMOST region (by its Start call site), so a nested ACCEPT is covered without
    // having been measured, and a region that cannot be paired refuses the whole procedure (`accept-unpaired`).
    //
    // NOT MEASURED, and so not claimed: REPORT/PRINT, nested ACCEPT, BREAK out of an ACCEPT. (LOOP i = 1 TO n
    // was measured later the same day: ESP constant over 23 iterations of SetupStringStops.)
    //
    // That rule alone was not enough (pipeline run 1): "no ACCEPT crossing" is not "ESP equal at the stop
    // and at the target". A move is now allowed by one of two paths - the PROOF (every call in the procedure
    // has a known effect on ESP, plus the ACCEPT rule) or the OBSERVED path (this frame instance already
    // stopped at the target with the current ESP). Both are below.
